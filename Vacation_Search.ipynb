    "1. Create a folder called `Vacation_Search` to save all the files related with this deliverable.\n",

    "2. Download the `Vacation_Search_starter_code.ipynb` Jupyter notebook,save it into your `Vacation_Search folder`, and rename it as `Vacation_Search.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the `Vacation_Search.ipynb` file, ensure that the dependencies and the Google API key is imported correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From the `Weather_Database` folder you created in the \"Deliverable 1,\" import the `WeatherPy_Database.csv` file as a Pandas DataFrame named `city_data_df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write two input statements that prompt the user to enter their minimum and maximum temperature criteria for their vacation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Create a new Pandas DataFrame by using the `loc` Pandas method to filter the `city_data_df` DataFrame for temperature criteria  collected. Name the DataFrame as `preferred_cities_df`.\n",

    "8. Use the `copy` Pandas function to create a new DataFrame, called `hotel_df`, by copying the following columns from the `clean_travel_cities` DataFrame: \"City\", \"Country\", \"Max Temp\", \"Current Description\", \"Lat\", \"Lng\".\n",

    "9. Add a new empty column named `Hotel Name` to the `hotel_df` DataFrame.\n",

    "15. Review the provided list comprehension code to retrieve the city data from each row, which will then be added to the formatting template and saved in the `hotel_info` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Use the provided code snippet to retrieve the latitude and longitude from each row and store them in a new DataFrame called `locations`.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. Refactor your previous marker layer map code to create a marker layer map that will have pop-up markers for each city on the map.\n",
